<h1>About Great Danes </h1>

<p>
Great Dane, a breed of working dog developed at least 400 years ago in Germany, where it was used for boar hunting. The Great Dane is typically<br> a swift, alert dog noted for courage, friendliness, and dependability. It has a massive square-jawed head and body lines that give it an elegant<br> appearance. </p>

<h3>What do great Danes need?</h3>
<p>The Great Dane’s size is the major challenge to its upkeep. The dog requires a large area in which to stretch out and sleep, preferably on soft<br> bedding to avoid callouses. It also needs a big vehicle in which to travel. Owners should have an emergency stretcher or other plan in case they<br> need to take an incapacitated Dane to a veterinarian. Everything costs more with a giant dog, including food, drugs, surgeries, boarding, and<br> bedding. Many Great Danes tend to drool a great deal, so they may not be the breed of choice for fastidious housekeepers. the Great Dane requires<br> an enclosed yard with a fence at least 6 feet (2 meters) high, although it is not a great jumper. Not excessively active, it still needs at least an hour <br>of interactive playing or walking each day. To prevent damage to their developing bones, Danes should not be taken for runs until they are at least<br> two years of age. The breed enjoys games of tug, running, hiking, and trick training. While some compete in agility, a Great Dane’s size makes<br> many of the standard obstacles very challenging. It prefers temperate weather, as it has little coat cover. However, because Danes are so large,<br> they build up heat more quickly than smaller dogs. Coat care is minimal, consisting of weekly brushing. However, during shedding season,<br> brushing should be done daily. Danes do not live long, averaging only 7 to 10 years of age. The breed is prone to gastric dilatation volvulus <br>(GDV), a bloating condition that is potentially fatal and can require immediate (and often costly) veterinary intervention. Many owners elect to,<br> have the dog’s stomach surgically attached to the abdominal wall to prevent the more severe complications associated with GDV.</p>

<h3>Their personality </h3>
<p>While “gentle giant” may be an overused phrase, it aptly describes the Great Dane. Though large, it is generally friendly and affectionate to both<br> family and strangers. Danes have a fairly low energy level, and, while playful, they are ready to quit and do something else after just a little while.<br> The breed is easy to train but is not a quick responder. It is an intimidating watchdog and a fair protection dog. Great Danes are usually friendly <br>toward unfamiliar dogs, and they get along well with housemates. The Great Dane does not bark without reason. Although its temperament makes <br>it an excellent choice for people of all ages, Dane’s size and strength can be too difficult for children or the elderly to manage. It should be noted <br>that these claims are a traditional and widely accepted generalization about the breed, and the behavior of individual Danes may differ.  </p><h6>Help from https://www.britannica.com/animal/Great-Dane <br><br>Made By Elysia Cabrera</h6>
