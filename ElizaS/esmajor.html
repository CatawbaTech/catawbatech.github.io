<p>I want to major in graphic design/or web page design. I want to major in this because i want to step out of my comfort zone and do something different. I love creating and adding colors, fonts, different types of elements to my projects, google slides, etc. I want to work really hard in school so when im off to college i will already know the beginner steps to make a web page and i can just jump right into it. </p>
